# Advanced-Programming
A banking application developed in C++ for my university's Computer Science course.

## Overview
The purpose of this assessment is to demonstrate an understanding of programming techniques such as low-level memory management, input/output, logical & mathematical concepts, and multi-paradigm development. The report documents the implementation and evaluation of the application, including the testing performed.
Users are able to perform the following tasks via a simple command-line interface:
- Open a new account of a specific type
- View an accountâ€™s balance and recent transactions
- Withdraw funds from an account
- Deposit funds into an account
- Transfer funds between accounts
- Project the interest earned on a savings account for a given period (in years)
- See a list of all the options above.
